Interactive Navigation Menu

### ðŸ“Œ Project Description

The Interactive Navigation Menu project is a modern and responsive web component designed to enhance user experience across websites. It features a fixed-position navigation bar that remains visible at the top of the page, ensuring easy access to different sections at all times.

The menu dynamically changes color and style when the user scrolls down, creating an engaging visual effect. Additionally, each menu item has hover animations with smooth underline effects, making the navigation more attractive and eye-catching.

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and can be easily integrated into any website. It not only improves accessibility but also adds a professional, modern look to webpages.
